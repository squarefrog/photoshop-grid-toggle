Photoshop Grid Toggle
=====================

A script for toggling visibility on a grid layer set.

##Installation##

###Mac OS X###
Place `Toggle Grid.jsx` in `/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CSx/Presets/Scripts` and restart Photoshop.

###Windows###
Place `Toggle Grid.jsx` in `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CSx\Presets\Scripts` and restart Photoshop.

##Usage##
When run, the script looks for a Layer or Layer Set with the name of `GRID`. It will then toggle visibility on and off. And it also automatically lock the `GRID` layer or layer set. If you name your grid layer set something other than GRID, feel free to change the variable.

##Toggling the script using keyboard##
You may bind the script to a keyboard key by opening the `Actions` pallete, and creating a new action. After creating the action, click the flyout menu and choose `Insert Menu Item`. Now trigger the script as usual: `File > Scripts > Toggle Grid`. 

You can now toggle the grid visibility by using a funciton key.
